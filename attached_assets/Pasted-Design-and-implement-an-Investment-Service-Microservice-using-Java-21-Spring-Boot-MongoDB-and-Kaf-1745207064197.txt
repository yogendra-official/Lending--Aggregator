Design and implement an Investment Service Microservice using Java 21, Spring Boot, MongoDB, and Kafka. The service should manage lender portfolios, handle investments, assess risk, provide diversification recommendations, and offer real-time updates via Kafka. It must also register with Eureka, expose Swagger documentation, and include monitoring via Actuator and Prometheus.

✅ Functional Modules
1. Lender Portfolio Management
Track:

Amount invested by each lender

Loan IDs linked to each investment

Current status of each investment

Calculate:

Total returns

Active vs matured investments

Portfolio-level risk score


2. Investment Decisioning
Allow lenders to:

Browse eligible loan opportunities

Filter by interestRate, loanTerm, creditScore

Invest a specified amount into selected loan

Validate:

Minimum/maximum investment limits

Whether the loan is still available for funding

MongoDB stores decision metadata

3. Risk Assessment & Diversification
Calculate:

Risk score of an individual investment (based on credit score, loan rating, etc.)

Portfolio-level diversification index

Suggest:

New loans that would balance risk

How to rebalance current allocations (e.g., invest more in low-risk)

4. Transaction Tracking
Every investment should be:

Persisted in MongoDB with a timestamp and metadata

Pushed as an event to Kafka for analytics/reporting

5. Real-Time Updates via Kafka
Produce Kafka events on:

New investment made

Return received

Loan status change (e.g., default, completed)

Kafka topic examples:

investment.created

investment.updated

returns.generated

✅ Testing Guidelines
Write unit tests for:

Portfolio calculations

Risk evaluation logic

Kafka producer (using EmbeddedKafka)

Use:

@DataMongoTest for Mongo

@WebMvcTest for controller

@MockBean for services

📦 Swagger & Eureka
Swagger docs exposed at /swagger-ui.html

Service registered with Eureka under investment-service

API Gateway can route calls like:

swift

Edit
GET /investment-service/api/investments/portfolio?lenderId=123
🧠 Bonus Ideas
Allow lenders to set "auto-invest" rules (cron or Kafka consumer)

Use a Kafka consumer to listen to loan.defaulted or loan.paid topics to update investment status

Integrate Redis to cache portfolio summaries for performance
